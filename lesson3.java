    //If statements
    //Create two integers and assign them to any integer or expression you want

    //if they are equal, print out the integers and the phrase "They are equal!"

    //if they are not equal, print out which one is greater

    //While Loops
    //make another integer variable called hi
    //print out the phrase "hello" for hi number of times

    //For Loops 
    //do the same thing using a for loop

    //CHALLENGE
    //What happens if you make a for loop inside a for loop??

    //if statement Example
    int int1 = 3*3+1;
    int int2 = 4*2;
    if (int1 == int2) {
      System.out.println("These integers are the same");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("These integers aren't the same");
    }
   
    //While loop Example
    while (int2 < int1) {
      System.out.println("Int2 is still less than int1");
      int2++; //Adds one to int2
    }
    //for loop example
    int myAge = 14;
    for (int count = 0; count < myAge; count++) {
      System.out.println(count + " is less than my age");
